# SEI-project-1

This is my first projest as part of my SEI course with General Assembly.
I've decided to make a version of Frogger. I'll be updating this README along the way to chart the trials and tribulations of this project.

I didn't get anywhere near as much done to the look of this game as I wanted. I naively thought the functionality would be a simple affair. It turns out it wasn't. So I will be working on this game from time to time to improve the look as well as introducing levels, better functionality and a nicer look. But I'm happy that the basic structure of the game is there. Lots more to learn!
